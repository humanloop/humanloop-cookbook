    "# Humanloop RAG Evaluation Walkthrough\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate how to take an existing RAG pipeline and integrate Humanloop in order to:\n",
    "1. Setup logging for your [Prompt](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/concepts/prompts).\n",
    "2. Create a [Dataset](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/concepts/datasets) and run Evaluations to benchmark the performance of your RAG pipeline.\n",
    "3. Configure [Evaluators](https://humanloop.com/docs/v5/concepts/evaluators) for monitoring your RAG pipeline in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Humanloop?\n",
    "Humanloop is an interactive development environment designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of LLM app development. It serves as a central hub where AI, Product, and Engineering teams can collaborate on Prompt management, Evaluation and Monitoring workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "- **Retrieval** - Getting the relevant information from a larger data source for a given a query.\n",
    "- **Augmented** - Using the retrieved information as input to an LLM.\n",
    "- **Generation** - Generating an output from the model given the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practise, it remains an effective way to exploit LLMs for things like question answering, summarization, and more, where the data source is too large to fit in the context window of the LLM, or where providing the full data source for each query is not cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the major challenges with RAG?\n",
    "Implementing RAG and other similar flows complicates the process of [Prompt Engineering](https://humanloop.com/blog/prompt-engineering-101) because you expand the design space of your application. There are lots of choices you need to make around the retrieval and Prompt components that can significantly impact the performance of your overall application. For example,\n",
    "- How do you select the data source?\n",
    "- How should it be chunked up and indexed?\n",
    "- What embedding and retrieval model should you use?\n",
    "- How should you combine the retrieved information with the query?\n",
    "- What should your system Prompt be? \n",
    "- Which model should you use?\n",
    "- What should your system message be?\n",
    "etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of versioning, evaluating and monitoring your pipeline therefore needs to consider both the retrieval and generation components. This is where Humanloop can help.\n"

    "# Example RAG Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need a reference RAG implementation. Our use case will be Q&A over a corpus of medical documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset**: we'll use a version of the [MedQA dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigbio/med_qa) from Hugging Face. This is a multiple choice question answering problem based on the United States Medical License Exams (USMLE), with reference text books that contain the required information to answer the questions.\n",
    "- **Retriever**: we're going to use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started) as a simple local vector DB with their default embedding model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. You can replace this with your favorite retrieval system.\n",
    "- **Prompt**: **the Prompt will be managed in code**, populated with the users question and the context retrieved from the Retriever and sent to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) to generate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to store your Prompts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, when the engineering/applied AI teams are mainly responsible for managing the details of the Prompt, then the pattern of storing or constructing the Prompt in code works well. This is the pattern we follow in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the Product/Domain Expert teams are more involved in Prompt engineering and management, then the Prompt can instead be managed on Humanloop and retrieved or called by your code - this workflow lies outside the scope of this tutorial and we cover it separately. "
