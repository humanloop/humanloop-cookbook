# node-instrumented-chat-agent

This demo project is a basic chat agent project instrumented with Humanloop. The instrumentation is done through the Typescript SDK decorators, which version and log to Files in your workspace automatically.

### Setup

* Run `yarn` in the project folder.

* Add your **HUMANLOOP_API_KEY** and **OPENAI_API_KEY** in an `.env` file in the same directory.

* `yarn start` You can now have a conversation with the agent. Type `exit` when you're done. The result should be available to Humanloop.
